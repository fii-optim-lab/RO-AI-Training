# Python for AI


The contents of this session will briefly cover basic Python features and will assume familiarity with programming and standard algorithms.


### 1. Python fundamentals
* The content of this Notebook will briefly cover basic Python features: [01-Introduction.ipynb](01-Introduction.ipynb).
  * Work through the exercises in this notebook to become familiar with basic Python usage.
* (Optional) We recommend the following resource for students who want to learn more Python: https://www.w3schools.com/python/.

### 2. NumPy - fast array library for Python

> - You will use NumPy for array-like data manipulation and transformations.
> - NumPy comes with a large body of mathematical functions usefull for AI.

* For a quickstarter, check https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html.
* Do the following exercises: [02-NumpyExercises.ipynb](02-NumpyExercises.ipynb)


### 3. Pandas and Matplotlib

> - You will use Pandas to load and manipulate csv data.
> - You will use Matplotlib for vizualization.

* Check [03-PandasMaplotlib.ipynb](03-PandasMaplotlib.ipynb).
